## There are three types of files:

# 1.	Deep learning on 3D lung CT Scans

# 2.	Machine Learning on Medical radiomic descriptors of lung cancer

# 3.	Object-oriented Project: This is a project using advanced object-oriented programming to determine the longest shortest path in a Graph. 
The results should be automatically displayed in a web page using the module Graphviz. You will just have to add your path to the bin file in the graphviz folder.
If you can't use Graphviz, I have joined a .html file showing the final results that are obtained.
